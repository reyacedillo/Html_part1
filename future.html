Developer trends are driven by innovations in distribution. Languages, platforms, frameworks, all of them offer new and, hopefully, improved way to package the value you create and share it with others to the power 10

In open source ecosystems distribution is the key differentiator. Node.js’ popularity, and the size of its ecosystem, are due in large part to a small set of compatibility patterns and a terrific package manager.

Our default workflow has been complicated by the needs of large web applications. Consider the following:

What if there was a way to have our cake and eat it too.

This is all un-styled, so you can add your own CSS to the page to do whatever you like.
A couple attempts at re-factoring to make it more pluggable but none of them worked until I went deep into WebComponents.

Before every npm publish, a small script runs that builds a standalone version of the libraries with a WebComponents polyfill loader.
frameworks have their place, but the only way to be compatible with any framework.

One of the earliest advocates for WebComponent standards, to talk about the reality.
This means we don’t need a separate release process for the standalone assets or any new fancy push to a CDN.
  
Combine this with jsdelivr and the assets are already on a CDN ready for people to include.

"Front-end development is tricky: it’s not difficult to learn, but it’s quite difficult to master. Luckily, developers and designers out there keep releasing useful tools and resources for all of us to learn, improve our skills and just get better at what we do."

A list of time-saving, useful HTML, CSS and JavaScript resources for you. I hope that these tools will help you to improve your skills as well as your professional workflow.
