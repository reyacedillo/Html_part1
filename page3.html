  Getting Started With CSS Flexbox Using Practical Examples
  By Samuel Norton


  Flexible boxes or flexbox, is the latest method for controlling layouts in CSS.
  Using grids that are ‘flexible’ is so easy to predict how each element behaves on
  different screen sizes. Its greatest feature is its ability to manipulate an item’s
  width/height to occupy all the space within its container (also known as a “flex container”) –
  otherwise, it shrinks to prevent overflow.


  If you’re new to flexbox, you might also like to take a look at these Guides,
  Tools & Frameworks for getting started with CSS Flexbox.

  ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
  }

  h2,h3,a {
  color: #34495e;
  }

  Next, we will set the width on our images using the box-flex property to auto.
  To specify a -moz-box or -webkit-box grows to fill the box that contains it.
  The rest of the code is simple media queries to manipulate the padding on a
  viewport with a maximum width of 480px.
  Set a width for the flex container which is the thumb class.
